**Intro**
  
This project is a kind of social media repository prototype that displays a profile and accompanying grid of pictures that users can like, all framed as part of a pseudo-journalistic, "journey across the U.S."; it's made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. (I.E. the grid shrinks to a single column to better fit mobile devices and some of the header content collapses into a centered column). This site currently displays properly/adapts to average monitors and the smallest phone resolutions.
  
**Figma** was an important layout technology used to block and plan the project. The implementation of **grids** and **media inquiries** were crucial in getting a proper responsive design.

**Images** were drawn both from a pre-existing directory, (for the higher quality "landscape photos,") and from extracting out of figma itself. (For the iconography where fidelity wasn't as important as per png's and vector files.)    

**Future ideas** would primarily revolve around expanding the responsiveness of the site to a wider variety of screen sizes to ensure a consistent smooth experience across devices.
